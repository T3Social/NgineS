This repository is empty but it enables everyone who is usig Sngine to contribute for a community edition.
- You can post issues
- we can have projects
- a Wiki is available where people can contribute

Extra code we post here under T3Social will be available under AGPLv.3 as long as Sngine itself is not licensed clearly under GPLv.2+ or GPLv.3 itself.
